# Hexai

![HexAI Small Logo](hexai-small.png)

Hexai, the AI LSP for the Helix editor.

## Ideas

* LSP server to be used with the Helix text editor
* Code completion using LLMs
* Code generation using LLMs text
* Be a replacement for 'github copilot cli'

Be able to select code blocks and perform code actions on them

* Commenting exiting code
* Code refactoring

Be able to chat with the LLM

* Have a dialog with the LLM, like in lsp-ai

Be able to switch LLMs. 

* Ollama local LLM models (e.g. Qwen Coder vs Deepseek-R1 for different purposes)
* OpenAI models
* Claude models
* Gemini models

MSPintegration? Can't think of a specic use case right now but it may be interesting!

## More

* Use of different LLM based on usage/use case
